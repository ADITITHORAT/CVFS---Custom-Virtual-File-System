# Custom Virtual File System (CVFS)

---

## üìå Project Overview
This project is an implementation of a **Custom Virtual File System (CVFS)** in C/C++.  
It emulates many functionalities of a real operating system‚Äôs file system but keeps all records in **primary memory (RAM)**, hence it is called *virtual*.  

The CVFS supports:

File management (creat, open, read, write, close, unlink).

Directory management (mkdir, rmdir, cd, ls).

Metadata retrieval (stat, fstat, chmod, find).

File navigation (lseek).

Utility commands (help, man, clear, exit, mkfs).
---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C / C++  
- **Compiler**: GCC / g++  
- **Platform**: Windows/Linux terminal  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface
- Console-based shell called **Marvellous CVFS**.  
- User enters commands similar to UNIX shell.  
- Provides built-in help and man pages.  

# Project Architecture

## Figure 1: Disk Layout
![Boot Block](architecture/Boot%20Block.png)  
**Description:** Disk layout showing Boot Block, Super Block, Disk Inode List Block (DILB), and Data Blocks (DB).

---

## Figure 2: File Handling Flow
![File Handling Flow](architecture/Flow.png)  
**Description:** Flow of file handling from UAREA ‚Üí File Table ‚Üí Incore Inode Table ‚Üí DILB ‚Üí DB.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Data Structures

### 1. **BootBlock**
- Stores information required to boot the file system.  
- Simulates the boot process of an OS.  

---

### 2. **SuperBlock**
- Tracks free and total inodes in the system.  
- Works like a control structure for the filesystem.  

**Fields:**
- `TotalInodes` ‚Üí Maximum number of files/directories that can exist.  
- `FreeInodes` ‚Üí Remaining inodes available for allocation.  

---

### 3. **Inode (Index Node)**

An **inode** represents each file or directory and stores its metadata. It functions similarly to UNIX inodes, providing essential information about files and directories. Each file/directory has a **unique inode**.

#### **Fields of an Inode**

- **FileName** ‚Üí Name of the file or directory  
- **InodeNumber** ‚Üí Unique identifier for the inode  
- **FileSize** ‚Üí Maximum allocated size (default: 100 bytes)  
- **ActualFileSize** ‚Üí Current size in use  
- **FileType** ‚Üí Specifies if it is a regular file or a directory  
- **LinkCount** ‚Üí Number of hard links to the file  
- **ReferenceCount** ‚Üí Number of active references (open handles)  
- **Permission** ‚Üí File access permissions (Read, Write, Read+Write)  
- **Buffer** ‚Üí Actual memory block storing the data  

#### **Additional for Directory Inodes**
- Maintain **parent**, **child**, and **sibling** references to manage directory structure efficiently.


---

### 4. **FileTable**
- Tracks opened files and offsets.  
- Maintains per-file session details like file descriptors.  

**Fields:**
- `ReadOffset`  
- `WriteOffset`  
- `Mode` (Read / Write / Read+Write)  
- `ptrinode` ‚Üí Pointer to the inode of the opened file  

---

### 5. **UAREA (User Area)**
- Represents process-level file management structure (like PCB).  
- Contains process info and User File Descriptor Table (UFDT).  

**Fields:**
- `ProcessName`  
- `CurrentDirectory`  
- `UFDT[]` ‚Üí Array of FileTables for open files
